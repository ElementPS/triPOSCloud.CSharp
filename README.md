## Overview

This repository demonstrates an integration to the triPOS Cloud product using c#.  The code was compiled and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop.  The application itself allows a user to perform the typical functions necessary to pair a lane with triPOS Cloud, run a sale transaction, and integrate to Store Card.

## Prerequisites

Please contact your Integration Analyst for any questions about the below prerequisites.

* Create Express test account: http://www.elementps.com/Resources/Create-a-Test-Account
* Request EMV simulator credentials from your Implementation Consultant
* Optionally install a hardware peripheral and obtain test cards (but you can be up and running without hardware for testing purposes)
* Currently triPOS is supported on Windows 7

## Documentation/Troubleshooting

* triPOS Cloud Integration Guide:  https://developer.vantiv.com/docs/DOC-2483
* triPOS Cloud Transaction API:  https://triposcert.vantiv.com/api/swagger-ui-bootstrap/
* triPOS Cloud Lane API:  https://triposcert.vantiv.com/cloudapi/swagger/ui/index#/

## Step 1: Pair a triPOS Cloud Lane

After plugging your triPOS Cloud device into power and obtaining a network connection (ethernet or wifi) your triPOS Cloud device should be showing an activation code.  Use the triPOS Cloud Lane API to POST a json request to:  https://triposcert.vantiv.com/cloudapi/v1/lanes/.

```
{
  "laneId": 1,
  "description": "test lane",
  "terminalId": "123",
  "activationCode": "1111111"
}

```

## Step 2: Send a Transaction to triPOS Cloud

Now that the device is paired to triPOS Cloud you should see the triPOS logo on the device.  The next step is to send a sale transaction.  Do this by using the triPOS Cloud transaction API to POST a json request to:  https://triposcert.vantiv.com/api/v1/sale.  Note:  use the same laneId as you used above, this laneId is the identifier for the device you paired above.  This is a simple json body and you will likely need to provide additional information for your use case.

```
{
	"laneId":"1",
	"transactionAmount":"6.22",
	"invokeManualEntry":false,
	"displayTransactionAmount":true,
	"configuration" : {
		"isManualEntryAllowed":"false",
		"promptForSignature":"UseThreshold",
		"thresholdAmount": "5.00"
	}
}

```

## Step 3: Receive response from triPOS Cloud

The response will be in a JSON format and you can leverage any JSON library to assist with parsing/serializing.  Only a portion of the response is include in the example below.

```
{
    "cashbackAmount": 0,
    "debitSurchargeAmount": 0,
    "approvedAmount": 0,
    "convenienceFeeAmount": 0,
    "subTotalAmount": 33.22,
    "tipAmount": 0,
    "emv": {
        "applicationIdentifier": "A0000000041010",
        "applicationLabel": "MasterCard",
        "applicationPreferredName": "MasterCard",
        "applicationTransactionCounter": "000C",
        "cryptogram": "AAC 25F0D6E108B41B11",
        "tags": [
            {
                "key": "50",
                "value": "4D617374657243617264"
        ],
        "issuerCodeTableIndex": "01",
        "pinBypassed": false
    },
    "fsaCard": "NotApplicable",
    "accountNumber": "************0681",
    "binValue": "541333",
    "cardHolderName": "Test Card 1",
    "cardLogo": "Mastercard",

    "entryMode": "ContactIcc",
    "expirationYear": "22",
    "expirationMonth": "12",
    "paymentType": "Credit",
    "pinVerified": true,
    "signature": {
        "statusCode": "SignatureNotRequiredByPaymentType"
    },
    "terminalId": "123",
